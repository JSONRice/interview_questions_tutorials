Problem description:

You are a bioinformatics programmer for a company that 
specializes in the development of software for a well known 
national biology laboratory. You have been given a file with 
the name of 'atoms.dat' from your team lead.
 
The file contains the following indexed ATOM data (column numbers added for clarity):


 1        2    3   4 5   6           7       8       9    10    11

ATOM      1  P     C A   1     -17.197 -29.456  11.510  0.00  0.00
ATOM      2  O1P   C A   1     -17.552 -29.312  10.073  0.00  0.00
ATOM      3  O2P   C A   1     -15.764 -29.858  11.698  0.00  0.00
ATOM      4  O5*   C A   1     -17.573 -28.201  12.414  0.00  0.00
ATOM      5  C5*   C A   1     -18.895 -27.610  12.314  0.00  0.00
ATOM      6  C4*   C A   1     -19.004 -26.592  13.423  0.00  0.00

ATOM      8  O4*   C A   1     -18.637 -27.217  14.674  0.00  0.00
ATOM      9  O2*   C A   1     -19.164 -24.177  15.061  0.00  0.00
ATOM     10  C2*   C A   1     -18.000 -24.941  14.783  0.00  0.00

This file is a stub mock file that is nearly complete. Your lead just 
called you and is going to a meeting and needs you to finish the test data.
You must provide mock data (populate) for columns 10 and 11. The only 
requirements are that column 10 is only allowed to contain integers 
ranging from -10 to 0 and column 11 may only contain integers ranging 
from 0 to 10. Your bosses meeting is short and she'll be back for the 
test file soon, so you have ten minutes to develop a quick Python
script to get the job done. You can read over this problem description 
but can't write any code until you have started the timer.

Hints:
Copy and past the ATOM rows into a file. Make sure each row is on it's own
line including the very last row. A cat of your file should reveal the
following on a Unix based terminal (Mac OS X or Linux):

[jsnrice@localhost input]$ cat atoms.dat 
ATOM      1  P     C A   1     -17.197 -29.456  11.510  0.00  0.00

ATOM     10  C2*   C A   1     -18.000 -24.941  14.783  0.00  0.00

*** Do everything on the command line as debugging on the command line
is trivial. ***
