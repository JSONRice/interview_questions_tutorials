        <h5 class="list-group-item-heading">Algorithm Complexity</h5>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">Algorithm complexity is a mathematical representation of the complexity 
          of a given algorithmic function. Algorithm efficiency is measured in notations such as Big-Oh.
          <br/><br/>
          Algorithmic function complexity should be written in italics as follows:
          <br/><br/>
          <i>&Omicron;(n)</i> - Standard Big-Oh notation representing the upper bound of &fnof;(n)
          <br/><br/>
          <i>&Theta;(n)</i> - Theta notation, representing the lower bound of &fnof;(n)
          <br/><br/>
          <i>o(n)</i> - Little-Oh notation, representing the upper bound but not equal to &fnof;(n) (approximation)
          <br/><br/>
          <i>&Omega;(n)</i> - Omega notation, representing the lower bound of &fnof;(n)
          <br/><br/>
          For the sake of brevity only Big-Oh notation is applied.
