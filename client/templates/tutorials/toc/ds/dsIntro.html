    <p>Welcome to Data Structures! Data structures are software components that store data.
      Often a data structure is represented as an Abstract Data Type containing one-to-many
      mathematically based operations such as search and delete. Data structures 
      encapsulate data in their various forms and may contain functions, variables, 
      and memory addresses. Data structures range in complexity from simple units
      such as arrays, to more complex data structures such as hash tables that combine 
      advanced functions with existing data structures in order to create smarter, 
      more dynamic data structures.</p>
